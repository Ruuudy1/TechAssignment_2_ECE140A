    <h1>Scrub Daddy Scratch-Free Dish Sponge by Scrub Daddy</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
        "high-performance cleaning products with unique materials and fun designs, offering texture-changing scrubbers, odor-resistant sponges" -from official website
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This sponge was featured in sharktank as the best sponge there is being multipupose and multiuse. When featured on sharktank, not only did it boast its build quality but its effectiveness with dish scrubbing. This is an example of a product that already exists in the market (regular sponge) but scrub daddy just does miles for similar price better making it the no brainer option.

    <h2>My Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        I strongly recommend this product as it is very cheap and one sponge will last you far longer than a traditional sponge while tackling deeps cleans much more efficiently.
